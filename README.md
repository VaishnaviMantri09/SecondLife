# Second-Life
Description About Project:

Our app is primarily based on the thought of goodwill/charity. If people have extra or used products that they want to rent/giveaway, 
ranging from something minuscule like books or something major like furniture or electronics, all they have to do is list it out on the app along with the images.
The buyer/renter can get in touch with the seller via the app. Further they can collect it based on the pickup location set up.
